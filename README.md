# 🚀 Dynamic DevSecOps Pipeline (End-to-End Automation)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **fully automated, dynamic DevSecOps pipeline** that provisions infrastructure, builds and deploys applications, and integrates **end-to-end security scanning (SAST, SCA, Container, DAST)**.

The pipeline is designed to work with **any GitHub repository** (with a Docker Compose setup) by simply providing input variables such as:

- 🔗 GitHub Repository URL  
- 🌿 Branch Name  
- 🌐 Application Port  

Once triggered, the pipeline automatically:

1. ⚙️ Provisions infrastructure using Terraform  
2. 🐳 Builds & pushes Docker image to AWS ECR  
3. 🔍 Performs code quality & security analysis (SonarCloud)  
4. 🛡️ Runs vulnerability scans (Trivy, OWASP Dependency Check)  
5. 🌍 Deploys the application on EC2  
6. 🚨 Performs DAST testing using OWASP ZAP  
7. 📊 Generates and stores all reports as GitHub Artifacts  
8. ♻️ Supports complete infrastructure teardown (Destroy phase)  

---

- Broken Authentication  
- Security misconfigurations  

### ⚙️ Pipeline Flow
1. Application deployed on EC2  
2. ZAP targets live URL  
3. Performs:
   - Passive Scan  
   - Active Scan  

### 📊 Output
- HTML report with:
  - Risk levels  
  - Attack vectors  
  - Affected endpoints  

---

## 🔄 Security Flow Integration

Security is not a single step — it's embedded across the pipeline:
Code → SAST → Build → Image Scan → Deploy → DAST → Report

---

## 🛡️ Why This Approach is Strong

- ✅ **Shift Left Security** (early detection)  
- ✅ **Multiple Layers of Protection**  
- ✅ **Automated Reporting**  
- ✅ **Covers Code → Dependency → Container → Runtime**  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

- SonarCloud depends on proper rule configuration  
- NVD API rate limits can slow Dependency Check  
- ZAP scans may increase pipeline execution time  
- False positives may require manual validation  

---

## 🚀 Security Outcome

By the end of the pipeline:

- Code is validated ✅  
- Dependencies are secured ✅  
- Container image is scanned ✅  
- Live application is tested ✅  

➡️ Result: **Production-ready, security-tested deployment**
